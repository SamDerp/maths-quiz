# Maths Quiz

This is a Maths quiz that currently tests basic addition, multiplication and subtraction skills. Currently it has the classes to store to a database, however this hasn't been integrated fully into the program yet, so they have to be called manually. It uses mongo to store data, and eventually will have nice user navigation. This is my A-Level project, which means that anyone looking to use this for A-Level purposes, will NEED to be careful, as the exam board will probably notice that it's very similar to my project and look into it.

## Getting Started

Run app.py to run the program. To use any of functions, such as store_to_database(), you will instead need to use the following format ```Startup.'ClassName'.'Function or variable name'``` 
E.G: ```Startup.Mongo.store_to_database()```


### Prerequisites

You will need to install python3 along with mongo & add to path.
